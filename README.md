featues:  
-saving game data both on file and mysql database  
-contains real game emotes  
etc.  
  

please be careful that the final version of game is on "new" branch
and this game's saving process is based on mysql. So, if you have problems in running the code, 
you might need to change all mysql commands to "currentUser.saveUser();"

good luck :)
